# A Minesweeper Clone for OS X
A very basic minesweeper clone. There are a lot of these. Source code only, download the repository and build it in XCode for a copy of the game.

* You can option-click instead of right-clicking to place flags if you don't like right-clicking.
* Use "New Game Plus" from the file menu to generate a board with a custom number of rows, columns, and mines.
